-- in this project I am using this dataset containing Spotify data: https://www.kaggle.com/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv
    to create a table and analyze some of the data with questions I came up with to explore the data

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- How many songs does each artist have in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY artist_name
;

-- Finding top ten artists & songs by popularity
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.\
-- Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, 
-- their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
